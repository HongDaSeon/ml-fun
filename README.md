# ml-fun

This is a repository for small fun machine learning projects I do in my free time.
Some are my own ideas, some are just my implementations of papers I find cool

Projects so far:
1. [ddpg](https://github.com/cthorrez/ml-fun/tree/master/ddpg) My implementation of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients
2. [kmeans_gd](https://github.com/cthorrez/ml-fun/tree/master/kmeans_gd) I implemented K-means clustering using gradient descent and Newton's method
3. [cma-es](https://github.com/cthorrez/ml-fun/tree/master/kmeans_gd) My implementation of Covariance Matrix Adaptation: Evolutionary Strategy.
